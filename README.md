# Color metronome
When playing a musical instrument, metronome sound sometimes is drowned out. So the color metronome allows you to follow rhythm by screen glow.

To try out this way please open the link http://cadmy.ru/metronome.html.

You can set the bpm rate by sending a parameter in a URL like http://cadmy.ru/metronome.html/metronome.html?bpm=120.

The default bpm is 80.
